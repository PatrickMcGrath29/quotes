  The life God bestows is imparted not once for all, but each moment
  continuously, by the unceasing operation of His mighty power. Humility, the
  place of entire dependence on God, is, from the very nature of things, the
  first duty and the highest virtue of the creature, and the root of every
  virtue.


  Humility is not so much a grace or virtue along with others; it is the root of all, because it alone takes the right attitude before God, and allows Him as God to do all... It is simply the sense of entire nothingness, which comes when we see how truly God is all, and in which we make way for God to be all.
