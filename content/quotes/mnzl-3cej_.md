  In this knowledge of Christ, there is an excellency above all other knowledge
  in the world; there is nothing more pleasing and comfortable, more animating
  and enlivening, more ravishing and soul contending; only Christ is the Sun and
  centre of all divine revealed truths, we can preach nothing else as the object
  of our faith, as the necessary element of your soul's salvation, which doth
  not some way or other, either meet in Christ, or refer to Christ;


  Only Christ is the whole of man's happiness, the Sun to enlighten him, the Physician to heal him, the Wall of fire to defend him, the Friend to comfort him, the Pearl to enrich him, the Ark to support him, the Rock to sustain him under the heaviest pressures... Only Christ is that ladder between earth and heaven, the Mediator between God and man, a mystery which the angels of heaven desire to pry, and peep and look into (1 Pet. 1:12). Here is a blessed subject indeed; who would not be glad to pry into it, to be acquainted with it? 'This is life eternal, to know God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent' John 17:8.


  Come then, let us look on this Sun of righteousness: we cannot receive harm but good by such a look; indeed by looking long on the natural sun, we may have our eyes dazzled, and our faces blackened; but by looking unto Jesus Christ, we shall have our eyes clearer, and our faces fairer...


  As Christ is more excellent than all the world, so this sight transcends all other sights; it is the epitome of a Christian's happiness, the quintessence of evangelical duties, Looking unto Jesus.
