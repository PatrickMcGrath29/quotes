text: In this knowledge of Christ, there is an excellency above all other
  knowledge in the world; there is nothing more pleasing and comfortable, more
  animating and enlivening, more ravishing and soul contending; only Christ is
  the Sun and centre of all divine revealed truths, we can preach nothing else
  as the object of our faith, as the necessary element of your soul's salvation,
  which doth not some way or other, either meet in Christ, or refer to Christ;
  only Christ is the whole of man's happiness, the Sun to enlighten him, the
  Physician to heal him, the Wall of fire to defend him, the Friend to comfort
  him, the Pearl to enrich him, the Ark to support him, the Rock to sustain him
  under the heaviest pressures.
