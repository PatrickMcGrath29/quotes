text: "'As sorrowful yet always rejoicing': these precious golden worlds teach
  us how the joy of Christ can overrule the sorrow of the world, can make us
  sing while we weep, and can maintain in the heart, even when cast down by
  disappointment or difficulties, a deep consciousness of a joy that is
  unspeakable and full of glory. There is but one condition: 'I will see you
  again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy shall no man take from you'.
  The presence of Jesus, distinctly manifested, cannot but give joy."
