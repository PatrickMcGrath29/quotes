text: God will not give me humility or patience or holiness or love as separate
  gifts of His grace. He's not a retailer dispensing grace to us in doses,
  measuring our some patience to the impatient, some love to the unloving, some
  meekness to the proud, in quantities that we take and work on as a kind of
  capital. He has given only one Gift to meet all our need â€” His Son, Christ
  Jesus. When I look to Him to live out His life in me, He will be humble and
  patient and loving and everything else I need in my stead. Remember the word
  in the first epistle of John, 'God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is
  in His Son. He that hath the Son hath the life, and that hath not the Son of
  God hath not the life'.
