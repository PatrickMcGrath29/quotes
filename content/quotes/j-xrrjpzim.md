  We are to live the life of the cross experientially. In going through to the
  place where we are made "conformable to His death," His Cross must become our
  cross. Then, what others see and hear of us bears the mark of the Cross which
  crucifies all manifestations of the fleshly life.


  All those who are progressing in the pursuit of the Lord and who live in the world should have no other compelling purpose but to receive constantly the power of resurrection life and to live out before men the life of the Cross. This is what gives the Lord full satisfaction and is so well-pleasing to Him.
