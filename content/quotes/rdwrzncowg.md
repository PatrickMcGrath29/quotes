  Mankind needs love. That was the one great need of mankind, that was the thing
  which Christ's redemption came to accomplish: to restore love to this world.


  One of the worst things sin did for man was to make him selfish, for selfishness cannot love. God's Son came to show what love is, and he lived a life of love here upon earth in fellowship with his disciples, in compassion over the poor and miserable, in love even to his enemiesâ€”and he died the death of love.


  And when He went to Heaven, whom did He send down? The Spirit of love, to come and banish selfishness and envy and pride, and bring the love of God into the hearts of men.
