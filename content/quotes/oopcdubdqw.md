text: "There is nothing smart about wrongdoing and nothing stupid about
  righteousness... We Christians must stop apologizing for our moral position
  and start making our voices heard, exposing sin for the enemy of the human
  race which it surely is and setting forth righteousness and true holiness as
  the only worthy pursuits for moral beings. "
