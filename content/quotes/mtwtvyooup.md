  Dear Christian! Do you not begin to see that waiting [on God] is not one among
  a number of Christian virtues, to be thought of from time to time, but that it
  expresses that disposition which lies at the very root of the Christian life?


  It gives higher value and a new power to our prayer and worship, to our faith and surrender, because it links us, in unalterable dependence, to God Himself. And it gives us the unbroken enjoyment of the goodness of God: "the Lord is good to them that wait for Him" (Lamentations 3:25).


  Let me press upon you once again to take time and trouble to cultivate this so much needed element of the christian life. We get too much of religion at second hand, from the tecahing of men. That teaching has great value if, even as the preaching of John the Baptist sent his disciples away from himself to the Living Christ, it leads us to God Himself. What our religion needs isâ€”more of God.


  Many of us are too much occupied with our work. As with Martha, the very service we want to render the Master separates from Him; it is neither pleasing to Him nor profitable to ourselves. The more work, the more need of waiting upon God; the doing of Hid's will would then, instead of exhausting, be our meat and drink, nourishment and refreshment and strength.


  "The Lord is good to them that wait for Him". How good none can tell but those who prove it in waiting on Him.
