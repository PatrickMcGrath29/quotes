  "I am the vine, you are the branches..." (John 15:5). The parable teaches us
  the nature of that union. The connection between the vine and the branch is a
  living one.


  The believers... union with his Lord is no work of human wisdom or human will, but an act of God, by which the closest and most complete life-union is effected between the Son of God and the sinner. "God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts." The same Spirit which dwelt and still dwells in the Son, becomes the life of the believer; in the unity of that one Spirit, and the fellowship of the same life which is in Christ, he is one with Him. 


  As between the vine and branch, it is a life-union that makes them one.
