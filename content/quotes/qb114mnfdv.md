text: '"God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts." The same
  Spirit which dwelt and still dwells in the Son, becomes the life of the
  believer; in the unity of that one Spirit, and the fellowship of the same life
  which is in Christ, he is one with Him. As between the vine and branch, it is
  a life-union that makes them one.'
