text: 'I was greatly impressed by something a great national leader wrote in his
  autobiography: "I want nothing for myself; I want everything for my country."
  If a man can be willing that his country should have everything and he himself
  nothing, cannot we say to our God: "Lord, I want nothing for myself; I want
  all for Thee. I will what Thou willest, and I want to have nothing outside Thy
  will."'
