  Must not everything first enter your judgement and consideration before it can
  delight your heart and affection? God does His work on us as men and in a
  rational way. He enables and energizes us to consider and study these
  delightful objects and thus to gather our own comforts as the bee gathers
  honey from the flowers...


  You will enjoy God only as much as you train your understanding and affections sincerely on Him.
