text: How many of us know that, because Christ is risen, we are therefore alive
  “unto God” and not unto ourselves? How many of us dare not use our time 	 or
  money or talents as we would, because we realize they are the Lord’s not ours?
  How many of us have such a strong sense that we belong to Another that we dare
  not squander a shilling of our money, or an hour of our time, or any of our
  mental or physical powers?
