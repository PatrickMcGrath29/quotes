text: It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too
  weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and
  ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to
  go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the
  offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.
