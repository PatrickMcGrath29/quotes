text: 'This absolute surrender to God will wonderfully bless us... But do
  remember, there must be absolute surrender. At every tea-table you see it. Why
  is tea poured into that cup? Because it is empty, and given up for the tea.
  But put ink, or vinegar, or wine into it, and will they pour the tea into the
  vessel? And can God fill you, can God bless you, if you are not absolutely
  surrendered to Him? He cannot. Let us believe God has wonderful blessings for
  us, if we will but stand up for God, and say, be it with a trembling will, yet
  with a believing heart: "O God, I accept thy demands. I am thine and all that
  I have..."'
