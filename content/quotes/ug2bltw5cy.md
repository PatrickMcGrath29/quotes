  God wished to reveal Himself in and through created beings by communicating to
  them as much of His own goodness and glory as they were capable of receiving.
  But this communication was not a giving to the creature something it could
  possess in itself, a certain life or goodness, of which it had the charge and
  disposal. By no means.


  But as God is the ever-living, ever-present, ever-acting One, who upholdeth all things by the word of His power, and in whom all things exist, the relation of the creature to God could only be one of unceasing, absolute, universal dependence.


  As truly as God by His power once created, so truly by that same power must God every moment maintain. The creature has not only to look back to the origin and first beginning of existence, and acknowledge that it there owes everything to God; its chief care, its highest virtue, its only happiness, now and through all eternity, is to present itself an empty vessel, in which God can dwell and manifest His power and goodness.
