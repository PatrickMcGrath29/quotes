  God wished to reveal Himself in and through created beings by communicating to
  them as much of His own goodness and glory as they were capable of receiving.
  But this communication was not a giving to the creature something it could
  possess in itself, a certain life or goodness, of which it had the charge and
  disposal...


  But as God is the ever-living, ever-present, ever-acting One, who upholdeth all things by the word of His power, and in whom all things exists, the relation of the creature to God could only be one of unceasing, absolute, universal dependence.
