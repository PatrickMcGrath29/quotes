text: Looking unto Jesus—to go forth from ourselves and to forget ourselves—so
  that our darkness may flee away before the brightness of His face; so that our
  joys may be holy, and our sorrow restrained; that He may cast us down, and
  that He may raise us up; that He may afflict us, and that He may comfort us;
  that He may despoil us, and that He may enrich us; that He may teach us to
  pray, and that He may answer our prayers; that while leaving us in the world,
  He may separate us from it, our life being hidden with Him in God, and our
  behavior bearing witness to Him before men.
