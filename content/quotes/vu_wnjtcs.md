text: It is the faith that continually closes its eyes to the weakness of the
  creature, and finds its joy in the sufficiency of an Almighty Saviour, that
  makes the soul strong and glad. It gives itself up to be led by the Holy
  Spirit into an ever deeper appreciation of that wonderful Saviour whom God
  hath given us--the Infinite Immanuel.
