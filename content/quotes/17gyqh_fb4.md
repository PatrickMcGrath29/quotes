  To get His best we must give our best. To become men and women after His Own
  heart, we must let Him have our undivided attention. To win, we must
  surrender. To live, we must die. To receive, we must give!


  Oh, the joy of such a life! There is nothing like it. All the success in the world cannot compensate for it. Friends can never mean so much. Even loved ones disappoint. Money brings its burdens, and fame its bitterness. But He satisfies!
