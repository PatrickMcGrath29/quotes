  When He says "Abide in Me," He offers Himself, the Keeper of Israel that
  slumbers not nor sleeps, with all His power and love, as the living home of
  the soul, where the mighty influences of His grace will be stronger to keep
  than all their feebleness to lead astray.


  The idea some have of grace is this—that their conversion and pardon are God's work, but that now, in gratitude to God, it is their work to live as Christians, and follow Jesus. There is always the thought of a work that has to be done, and even though they pray for help, still the work is theirs. They fail continually, and become hopeless; and the despondency only increases the helplessness.


  No, wandering one; as it was Jesus who drew you when He spake "Come," so it is Jesus who keeps you when He says "Abide." The grace to come and the grace to abide are alike from Him alone.
