  Be more and better acquainted with Jesus Christ: get nearer to him, be more in
  communion with him, get more tastes of Christ and heaven, and earth will
  relish the worse for them [the pleasures of the world].


  Oh! when I look on Christ and consider. That he that was the Lord of heaven and earth, put himself into so poor and low a condition, merely for the redeeming of his elect, how should this but deaden my heart to the world? "I account all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; and account them but dung, that I may win Christ," (Philippians 3:8). If Christ be in view, all the world then is but dung and dross, and loss in comparison; the glory of Christ will darken all other things in the world.
