  Looking unto Jesus—and not to our brethren, not even to the best among them
  and the best beloved. In following a man—we run the risk of losing our way. In
  following Jesus—we are sure of never losing our way. Besides, in putting a man
  between Jesus and ourselves, it will come to pass that insensibly the man will
  increase, and Jesus will decrease; and soon we no longer know how to find
  Jesus when we cannot find the man, and if he fails us, all fails.


  On the contrary, if Jesus is kept between us and our closest friend, our attachment to the person will be at the same time less enthralling, and more deep; less passionate, and more tender; less necessary, and more useful; an instrument of rich blessing in the hands of God, when He is pleased to make use of him; and whose absence will be a further blessing, when it may please God to dispense with him, to draw us even nearer to the only Friend who can be separated from us by “neither death nor life”
