  Though in fact I am in Christ, yet if I live in the flesh—that is, in my own
  strength and under my own direction—then in experience I find to my dismay
  that it is what is in Adam that manifests itself in me.


  If I would know in experience all that is in Christ, then I must learn to live in the Spirit.
