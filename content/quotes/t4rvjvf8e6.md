text: Put away every un-Christian habit from you. If other Christians practice
  it without compunction, God may be calling you to come nearer to Him than
  these other Christians care to come. Remember the words, "Others may, you
  cannot." Do not condemn or criticize, but seek a better way. God will honor
  you.
