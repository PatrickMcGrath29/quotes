  See what a work the Lord foreshadowed when He said those simple words, “I am
  going there to prepare a place for you.” What sort of a place are you aiming
  at? Yes, you would rather be a doorkeeper there than to dwell in the tents of
  wickedness. But this is not now the question. Would you prefer to be a
  doorkeeper to being an ambassador? Would you prefer to serve self, and
  pleasure, and wealth on earth, and be of little or no use hereafter; or will
  you choose to live for Christ heart and soul, forgetting things past and
  pressing on toward the mark, keen and strong. Which?


  Christ is preparing your place. He is, to that end, watching your course on earth. The sons of Zebedee demanded to sit on the right and left of the King Himself. Do not follow the other disciples in their anger at this request. It is well to aim high. It is contemptible to seek merely to “get saved.” But remember our Lord’s reply to the disciples, “Can ye drink of My cup, and be baptized with My baptism?” Ah, that is it! We are carving out our own destiny every moment. The Judgment Seat of Christ will settle all. There will be no respect of persons there. But the faithful servant will take a higher place and portion, and the slothful and worldly will be saved, that is all.
