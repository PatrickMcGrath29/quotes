  O turn your thoughts from off all earthly vanities, and bend your souls to
  study Christ. Habituate yourselves to such contemplations... and let not those
  thoughts be seldom or cursory, but settle upon them, dwell there, bathe your
  souls in those delights, drench your affections in those rivers of pleasures,
  or rather in the sea of consolation. O tie your souls in heavenly galleries,
  have your eyes continually set on Christ!


  Say not, "You are unable to do thus, this must be God's work only, and therefore all our exhortations are in vain..." Though God be the chief disposer of your hearts, yet next under him you have the greatest command of them yourselves. Though "without Christ ye can do nothing;" yet under him you may do much: or else it will be undone, and you undone through your neglect.


  If your souls were sound and right, they would perceive incomparably more delight and sweetness, in knowing, thinking, believing, loving and rejoicing in Jesus Christ, than the soundest stomach finds in his food, or the strongest senses in the enjoyments of their objects.


  Oh it is our sloth, our security, our carnal mind, which is enmity to God and Christ, that keeps us off. Be exhorted! Oh be exhorted in the fear of God.
