text: 'I began to realize the truth of Philippians 4:19, "And my God shall
  supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus." It
  was true on all levels, not just for financial issues, nor yet only for
  spiritual mysteries on an exalted plane, but also for everyday, down-to-earth
  emotional needs of soul and body. As I began to move out of "feelings" and on
  to "facts," I realized that He was satisfying me, not only with an inner
  assurance of salvation and forgiveness, but also with a reality of love and
  depth of companionship that actually took from me, at that time, any sense of
  need or loneliness. Christ was truly becoming my "sufficiency": I was learning
  to love Him with all my soul.'
