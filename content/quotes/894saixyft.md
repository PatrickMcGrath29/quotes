  The command is clear: Humble yourself... Take every opportunity to humble
  yourself before God and man. Humble yourself in the faith of the grace that is
  already working in you, and in the assurance of more grace that is coming.


  Accept with gratitude everything that God allows from within or without, from friend or enemy, in nature or in grace, to remind you of your need of humbling, and to help you to it.


  Consider humility to be the mother-virtue, your very first duty before God, the one constant safeguard of the soul, and set your heart on it as the source of all blessing. The promise is divine and sure. He that humbles himself will be exalted. Be sure you do the one thing God asks, and humble yourself. God will be faithful to do the one thing He promised. He will give more grace, and He will exalt you in due time.
