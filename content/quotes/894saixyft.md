  The command is clear: Humble yourself... Take every opportunity to humble
  yourself before God and man. Accept with gratitude everything that God allows
  from within or without, from friend or enemy, in nature or in grace, to remind
  you of your need of humbling, and to help you to it.


  Consider humility to be the mother-virtue, your very first duty before God, the one constant safeguard of the soul, and set your heart on it as the source of all blessing. The promise is divine and sure. He that humbles himself will be exalted. Be sure you do the one thing God asks, and humble yourself. God will be faithful to do the one thing He promised.
