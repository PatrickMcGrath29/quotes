  God is seeking that we worship Him. Worship in spirit, worship Him in truth,
  worship Him in the very beauty of holiness.


  You know, at the end of this day, however much I preach, however much you sing, however much you serve, the Lord is going to get a record. And I try to do this: I try to say at the end of the day, "Lord, it's not what I preached over TV, or radio, to millions. Or two, or three, or one person I visited who was sick... But, Lord, did I kiss You today? Or did You look down and say, 'Son, you were very busy, very active, you made some new friends, people said you preached well, but listen son, thou gavest Me no water, thou gavest Me no oil, thou gavest Me no kiss.
