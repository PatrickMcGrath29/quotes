  Let us get it crystal clear in our hearts and mind that the only Person who
  ever lived the Christian life was Jesus Christ, and the only Person that God
  ever intended to live the Christian life was Jesus Christ. The only part that
  you and I play on earth today is to provide Him with human vehicles to that
  end. Hands and feet and lips; hearts to love with and eyes to see with. That
  is our part, and it is in the infinite, unspeakable mercy of God that even
  this privilege may be ours. But what a wonderful thing to consent to this fact
  and to know that Jesus Christ lives His life through you.


  What are the limits? What are the possibilities? This is the place where you quit begging and start praising God. You need not come, cap in hand, asking God for this and asking God for that. You only have to know that at any given moment Jesus Christ has the right of way in your life and you’re in the place where God wants you. You don’t have to beg for blessing. You thank Him in anticipation. It is inevitable.
