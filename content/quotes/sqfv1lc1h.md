text: "A pastor in India once told me he was researching movements and noticed a
  common thread: movements of God always start with a leader who knows God
  deeply, and they always end when the followers know only the leader deeply.
  Pastors, we must know Him deeply and make disciples whose primary attachment
  is to Christ Himself."
