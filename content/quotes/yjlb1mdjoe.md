text: "I do not pray that you may be delivered from your pains; but I pray God
  earnestly that He would give you strength and patience to bear them as long as
  He pleases. Comfort yourself with Him who holds you fastened to the cross: He
  will loose you when He thinks fit. Happy those who suffer with Him: accustom
  yourself to suffer in that manner, and seek from Him the strength to endure as
  much, and as long, as He shall judge to be necessary for you."
