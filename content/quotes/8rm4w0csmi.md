  The secret and reality of a blissful life in God cannot be understood without
  receiving, living, and experiencing it. If we try to understand it only with
  the intellect, we will find our effort useless. A scientist had a bird in his
  hand. He saw that it had life, and, wanting to find out in what part of the
  birdâ€™s body the life was, he began dissecting the bird. The result was that
  the very life of which he was in search disappeared mysteriously. Those who
  try to understand the inner life merely intellectually will meet with a
  similar failure. The life for which they are looking will vanish in the
  analysis.


  In comparison with this big world, the human heart is only a small thing. Though the world is so large, it is utterly unable to satisfy this tiny heart. Our ever growing soul and its capacities can be satisfied only in the infinite God. As water is restless until it reaches its level, so the soul has no peace until it rests in God.
