text: "Looking unto Jesus, to receive from Him the task and the cross for each
  day, with the grace which is sufficient to carry the cross and to accomplish
  the task; the grace that enables us to be patient with His patience, active
  with His activity, loving with His love; never asking 'What am I able for?'
  but rather: 'What is He not able for?' and waiting for His strength which is
  made perfect in our weakness"
