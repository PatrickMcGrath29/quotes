text: We are often hindered from giving up our treasures to the Lord out of fear
  for their safety. This is especially true when those treasures are loved
  relatives and friends. But we need have no such fears. Our Lord came not to
  destroy but to save. Everything is safe which we commit to Him, and nothing is
  really safe which is not so committed.
