text: Is the living Person now in heavenly glory really the Object of our
  hearts? For some time after I knew the Savior I used to think of Him as One
  who had lived and died on earth long years ago, and I well remember the day
  when I knelt down with a dear brother who prayed that we might know the Lord
  Jesus as a living Person in heavenly glory, and it dawned on me that there was
  a present Object for my heart in heaven. Our hearts will never be satisfied
  until that glorified Lord Jesus becomes our object, bright and fair.
