text: This is definitely not the hour when men take kindly to an exhortation to
  listen, for listening is not today a part of popular religion. We are at the
  opposite end of the pole from there. Religion has accepted the monstrous
  heresy that noise, size, activity and bluster make a man dear to God. But we
  may take heart. To a people caught in the tempest of the last great conflict
  God says, “Be still, and know that I am God,” and still He says it, as if He
  means to tell us that our strength and safety lie not in noise but in silence.
