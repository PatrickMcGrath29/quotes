  I have a pen in my pocket, and that pen is absolutely surrendered to the one
  work of writing. That pen must be absolutely surrendered to my hand if I am to
  write properly with it. If another holds it partly, I cannot write
  properly....

  The temple of Solomon was absolutely surrendered to God when it was dedicated to Him. And every one of us is a temple of God, in which God will dwell and work mightily on one condition-absolute surrender to Him.
