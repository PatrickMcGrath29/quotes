text: In our desire after God, let us keep always in mind that God also has a
  desire, and His desire is toward the sons of men, and more particularly toward
  those sons of men who will make the once-for-all decision to exalt Him over
  all. Such as these are precious to God above all treasures of earth or sea. In
  them God finds a theater where He can display His exceeding kindness toward us
  in Christ Jesus. With them God can walk unhindered, toward them He can act
  like the God He is.
