text: The most excellent subject to discourse or write of is Jesus Christ.
  Augustine, having read Cicero's works, commended them for their eloquence; but
  he passed this sentence upon them, “They are not sweet, because the name of
  Jesus is not in them.” … Indeed all we say is but unsavory, if it not be
  seasoned with this salt, “I determined not to know any thing among you, (saith
  Paul) save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.” He resolved with himself, before
  he preached among the Corinthians, that this should be the only point of
  knowledge that he would profess himself to have skill in.
