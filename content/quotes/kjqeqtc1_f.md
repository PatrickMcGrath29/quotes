  To be a living sacrifice will in move all my time. God wants me to live every
  minute for Him in accordance with His will and purpose, sixty minutes of every
  hour, twenty-four hours of every day, being available to Him. No time can be
  considered as my own, or as “off-duty” or “free”. I cannot barter with God
  about how much time I can give to serve Him. Whatever I am doing, be it a
  routine salaried job, or housework at home, be it holiday time and free, or
  after-work Christian youth activities, all should be undertaken for Him, to
  reveal His indwelling presence to those around me.


  To be a living sacrifice will involve all my possessions. Everything that I have is in trust, be it financial or material. All should be available to God for the furtherance of His Kingdom. My money is His… I must look to Him for guidance in its use, with no sense that a certain percentage is my own by right of labor. I relinquish that right to Him. He has the right to direct the spending of each penny. 


  To be a living sacrifice will involve all of myself. My will and my emotions, my health and vitality, my thinking and activities, all are to be available to God, to be employed as He chooses, to reveal Himself to others. Should He see that someone would be helped to know Him through my being ill, I accept ill health and weakness. I have no right to demand what we call good health… All rights are His — to direct my living so that He can most clearly reveal Himself through me. 


  I gladly accept His best will for my life… I need to be so utterly God’s that He can use me or hide me, as He chooses, as an arrow in His hand or on His quiver. I will ask no questions: I relinquish all rights to Him, who desires my supreme good. He knows best.
