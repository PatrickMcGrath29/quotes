  We must learn of Jesus, how He is meek and lowly of heart. He teaches us where
  true humility takes its rise and finds its strength - in the knowledge that it
  is God who worketh all in all, and that our place is to yield to Him in
  perfect resignation and dependence, in full consent to be and to do nothing of
  ourselves.


  This is the life Christ came to reveal and to impart - a life to God that came through death to sin and self.


  The root of all virtue and grace, of all faith and acceptable worship, is that we know that we have nothing but what we receive, and bow in deepest humility to wait upon God for it.
