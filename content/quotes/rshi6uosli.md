  "When Christ our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory."
  Colossians 3:4


  Suddenly one day we see that Christ is our life. That day everything is changed. There is a day when we see ourselves in Christ. After that, nothing can make us see ourselves outside of Him. It alters everything. Then also there is a day when we see that Christ within us is our life. That too alters our whole outlook.


  They may be different days with an interval between, or both may come together. But we must have both; and when we do, then we begin to know Christ’s fullness, and to marvel that we have been so stupid hitherto as to remain poor in God’s storehouse.
