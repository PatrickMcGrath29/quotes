  In the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee. That will prove
  true in our inner experience. If we are honest in our longing for holiness and
  in our prayer to be wholly the Lord’s, His holy presence will arouse and
  discover hidden sin and convict us of our evil nature, its opposition to God’s
  law, and its inability to fulfill that law. The words will come true: 


  "Who may abide the time of his coming? And who shall stand when he appears? For he shall be like a refiner’s fire" (Malachi 3:2). "Oh that thou would... come down... as when the melting fire burns" (Isaiah 64:1-2).


  God executes His judgments upon sin within the soul in great mercy, as He makes it feel its wickedness and guilt. Many try to flee from these judgments; the soul that longs for God and for deliverance from sin bows under them in humility and in hope.
