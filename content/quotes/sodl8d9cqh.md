text: He who grows in grace remembers that he is but dust, and he therefore does
  not expect his fellow Christians to be anything more. He overlooks ten
  thousand of their faults, because he knows his God overlooks twenty thousand
  in his own case. He does not expect perfection in the creature, and,
  therefore, he is not disappointed when he does not find it.
