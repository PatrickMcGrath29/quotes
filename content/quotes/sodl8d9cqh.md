  He who grows in grace remembers that he is but dust, and he therefore does not
  expect his fellow Christians to be anything more.


  He overlooks ten thousand of their faults, because he knows his God overlooks twenty thousand in his own case.


  He does not expect perfection in the creature, and, therefore, he is not disappointed when he does not find it.
