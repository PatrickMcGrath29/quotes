  Plenty of experiences confirm to us that many who are skillful in creating hot
  atmosphere know very little of the Lord, many excitable persons are quite
  lacking in the knowledge of the Lord. 


  Only Christ is life, the rest is not.


  For life depends not on how enthusiastic is our emotion or on how manifold is our thought; it rests exclusively on whether the Lord has manifested His own self. There is therefore nothing more important than to know the Lord.


  If we know the Lord as our life, we realize the utter futility of all natural efforts in spiritual matters. Hence we look to Him alone.
