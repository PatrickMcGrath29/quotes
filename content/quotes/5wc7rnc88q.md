  Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, lay aside all private and earthly
  affections, and look upon this glory of Christ. As the daughters of Jerusalem
  sitting or remaining in their chambers, closets, houses, could not behold the
  glory of King Solomon passing by, and therefore they were willed to come forth
  of their doors: even so, if we will behold the great King, Jesus Christ in his
  most excellent glory (a sight able to satisfy the eye, and to ravish the
  heart) we must come out of our doors, we must come out of ourselves, otherwise
  we cannot see his glory.


  "Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, the day of the gladness of his heart."

  Song of Solomon 3:11
