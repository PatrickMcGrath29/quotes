text: You probably know the illustration of Fact, Faith and Experience walking
  along the top of a wall. Fact walked steadily on, turning neither to right nor
  left and never looking behind. Faith followed and all went well so long as he
  kept his eyes focused upon Fact; but as soon as he became concerned about
  Experience and turned to see how he was getting on, he lost his balance and
  tumbled off the wall, and poor old Experience fell down after him.
