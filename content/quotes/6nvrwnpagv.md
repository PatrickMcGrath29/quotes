  He whose life is one even and smooth path, will see but little of the glory of
  the Lord, for he has few occasions of self-emptying, and hence, but little
  fitness for being filled with the revelation of God. They who navigate little
  streams and shallow creeks, know but little of the God of tempests; but they
  who ‘do business in great waters,’ these see his ‘wonders in the deep.’ Among
  the huge Atlantic-waves of bereavement, poverty, temptation, and reproach, we
  learn the power of Jehovah, because we feel the littleness of man. 


  Thank God, then, if you have been led by a rough road: it is this which has given you your experience of God’s greatness and lovingkindness... Praise God that you have not been left to the darkness and ignorance which continued prosperity might have involved, but that in the great fight of affliction, you have been capacitated for the outshinings of his glory in his wonderful dealings with you.
