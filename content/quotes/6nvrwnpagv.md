  He whose life is one even and smooth path, will see but little of the glory of
  the Lord, for he has few occasions of self-emptying, and hence, but little
  fitness for being filled with the revelation of God.


  They who navigate little streams and shallow creeks, know but little of the God of tempests; but they who ‘do business in great waters,’ these see his ‘wonders in the deep.’ Among the huge Atlantic-waves of bereavement, poverty, temptation, and reproach, we learn the power of Jehovah, because we feel the littleness of man.
