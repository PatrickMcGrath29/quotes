  As we embark upon discipleship we surrender ourselves to Christ in union with
  His deathâ€”we give over our lives to death. Thus it begins; the cross is not
  the terrible end to an otherwise god-fearing and happy life, but it meets us
  at the beginning of our communion with Christ.


  When Christ calls a man, He bids him come and die.
