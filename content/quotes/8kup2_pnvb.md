text: God, I saw, demanded my undivided attention. Everything else must take a
  second place. Friends and loved ones, home, money, work, all—even though
  legitimate—must give way to Christ! Day and night my undivided attention must
  be given to Him. God first! Such must be my attitude toward Him. Only then
  would He be able to bless and use me.
