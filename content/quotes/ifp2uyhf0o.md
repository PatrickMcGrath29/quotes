  This mystery of union is God's work by which the unsearchable riches of Christ
  become ours. Do we believe this? All that is Christ's is ours. Do we believe
  that God has given us His holiness, perfection, life, power and riches? God
  has joined us to Christ causing Him to be our head, our trunk and our food.


  Do we believe that Christ is now our righteousness and sanctification and redemption? Do we believe He is presently living out His life in us? God has indeed invited us, nay, He has commanded us to believe. Our union with Christ is patterned after the union of Christ with God; therefore, His patience, gentleness, purity and goodness are all ours. Just as in initial salvation we previously believed Him to be our righteousness, so today let us likewise believe Him to be our holiness.


  Yet how many fail in this respect. They know God's way of victory, but they do not have the faith. They know their inability, but they do not know Christ's ability. They see the total corruption of their flesh, but they do not see the riches of Christ as God's gift to them.
