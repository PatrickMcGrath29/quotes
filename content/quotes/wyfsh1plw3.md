text: "God, as Creator, formed man, to be a vessel in which He could show forth
  His power and goodness. Man was not to have in himself a fountain of life, or
  strength, or happiness: the ever-living and only living One was each moment to
  be the Communicator to him of all that he needed. Man's glory and blessedness
  was not to be independent, or dependent upon himself, but dependent on a God
  of such infinite riches and love. Man was to have the joy of receiving every
  moment out of the fulness of God."
