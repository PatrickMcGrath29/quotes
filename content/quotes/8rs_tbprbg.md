  We must see that, before God, Christ is everything to us. 


  "I am the life," says the Lord. Life is therefore not any matter outside of Christ; it is Christ Himself.


  Many people mistake knowledge, doctrine, theology and teaching as the light of life. The real light is not mere knowledge. It is none other than the Lord Himself.
