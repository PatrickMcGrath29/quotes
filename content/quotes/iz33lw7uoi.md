text: "If we give ourselves unreservedly to God, many adjustments may have to be
  made: in family, or business, or church relationships, or in the matter of our
  personal views. God will not let anything of ourselves remain. His finger will
  touch, point by point, everything that is not of Him, and He will say: 'This
  must go.' Are you willing?"
