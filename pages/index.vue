              We all know the value of joy. It alone is the proof that what we
              have really satisfies the heart.

              In our desire after God, let us keep always in mind that God also
              has a desire, and His desire is toward the sons of men, and more
              particularly toward those sons of men who will make the
              once-for-all decision to exalt Him over all. Such as these are
              precious to God above all treasures of earth or sea. In them God
              finds a theater where He can display His exceeding kindness toward
              us in Christ Jesus. With them God can walk unhindered, toward them
              He can act like the God He is.

              I do not pray that you may be delivered from your pains; but I
              pray GOD earnestly that He would give you strength and patience to
              bear them as long as He pleases. Comfort yourself with Him who
              holds you fastened to the cross: He will loose you when He thinks
              fit. Happy those who suffer with Him: accustom yourself to suffer
              in that manner, and seek from Him the strength to endure as much,
              and as long, as He shall judge to be necessary for you.

              With a heart full of joy no work can weary, and no burden can
              depress; God Himself is strength and song.

              There is no proof of the reality of Godâ€™s love and the blessing He
              bestows, which men so soon feel the force of, as when the joy of
              God overcomes all the trials of life.
